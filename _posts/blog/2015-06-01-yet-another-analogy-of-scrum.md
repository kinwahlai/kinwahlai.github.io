My colleague [Bas Vodde](https://less.works/profiles/basvodde) shared on how he share a product owner roles in 1 of his Certified LeSS Practitioner course. Here is what he said and i think it is a good one.

> Product owner is like a customer having dinner in a restaurant. He has limited money and stomach space, so he "prioritize" what he want to eat and order. Then he wait for the food. He doesn't go to the kitchen and tell the chef how to cook.

Just recently, i attended Michael Feather's course in Singapore. He shared another analogy about refactoring.

> Chefs in fine dinning restaurant will always clean their tools after they use it. Because this will slow you down in future when you want to use the tool. It is discipline and it is a habit to develop.

Maybe i watch too much Gordon Ramsay recently, all these triggers me to come up with another (yet another) analogy with restaurant.

> Development team is like chefs working in restaurant. It doesnt matter how good the dish looks or tastes if you do not deliver to customer. You cannot deliver crappy food to customer too just because it has tight deadline.

There are many analogies or examples to describe the simple yet hard to master Scrum process. So just find and use the one that create resonance with you.
