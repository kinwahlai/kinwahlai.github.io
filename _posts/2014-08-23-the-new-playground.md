The first line in Playground file is "Playground - noun: a place where people can play". Yes it is a place for developer to play around with Swift. Swift, the new programming language announced in WWDC 2014 and Playground is an interactive environment to experiment with swift code.
<h3>What is playground?</h3>
It looks like a simple text editor but it definitely does more than that. You can type your swift code on the left and then it will just compile and run your code. Just like that. It provides quick feedback for your coding experiments without requiring you to compile manually or running a complete project. Playground changes the way you learn programming language.

<h3>What can I do with playground?</h3>
Well,you can try out experiments with playground without setting up the full project. For example, a formula for your application or a paint code for your application. Playground allows you to visualize the result on the right hand side of the editor. It works for Cocoa or UIKit. There are more to explore with playground.

<h3>Things i wish to see in Playground</h3>
After poking around and reading the document, i realize that it is not possible to interact with playground yet. I wish i can draw a UIButton and tap on that button to trigger an action in future playground release.
<h3>Playground comes with Xcode 6</h3>
You can download Xcode 6 beta from [https://developer.apple.com/xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) with a valid apple developer account.
