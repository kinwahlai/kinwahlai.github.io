Short answer, yes. Long answer depends. But before we going into should we estimate all items in Product backlog, we should understand why we want to estimate?

Why do we estimate items?

during estimation, trigger discussion leads to better understanding of the problem.
address some invalid assumption
find a simpler solution to the problem, or even break down problem into smaller sub problem where solution can be implemented in phases

PB are in ODDE, estimation helps PO to make decision which item/story to have 1st.
*** ?estimation also show us what compromise we making, grouping of story as a feature (may include low value item)



What if we dont estimate, what will happen?



When do we estimate?

PBR, immediately when new items added


Do we re-estimate item?

No - mike cohn book say no.

#noestimate
